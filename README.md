That was the news of the update (Beta 2.0) they were few but they were also laborious, Nice Weekend!!!|
The News (Beta):|
THE BETA IS FINALLY UPLOADED!!!|
·The "ERROR 001" was added, the "ERROR 001" is caused by misplaced the number of the beginning message (the one that says "dial 1 to add").|
Example:|
"Choose what you want to do, mark 1 to add two numbers, mark 2 to subtract two numbers, mark 3 to multiply 2 numbers or mark 4 to divide two numbers"|
5|
ERROR 001, try again|
"Choose what you want to do, mark 1 to add two numbers, mark 2 to subtract two numbers, mark 3 to multiply 2 numbers or mark 4 to divide two numbers"|
·Bug of not being able to multiply fixed, it was due to a small error when naming the methods|
·"I am going to ask you to use commas instead of points in case the numbers you are going to use are decimals, example: 123,123" added temporarily to
the message at the beginning, it was added because we wanted to avoid errors when writing decimals|
·While added, it is now an infinite calculator!!! It was complicated to add, I had to change the structure of the code completely|
·THE "README" HAS BEEN ADDED!!!|
·Secret comment added in the code!!!|
That was the news of the earlier version (Beta)|
