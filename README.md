The Genathor Times
THE BETA IS FINALLY UPLOADED!!!
The News:
·The "ERROR 001" was added, the "ERROR 001" is caused by misplaced the number of the beginning message (the one that says "dial 1 to add").
Example:
"Choose what you want to do, mark 1 to add two numbers, mark 2 to subtract two numbers, mark 3 to multiply 2 numbers or mark 4 to divide two numbers"
5
ERROR 001, try again
"Choose what you want to do, mark 1 to add two numbers, mark 2 to subtract two numbers, mark 3 to multiply 2 numbers or mark 4 to divide two numbers"
·Bug of not being able to multiply fixed, it was due to a small error when naming the methods
·"I am going to ask you to use commas instead of points in case the numbers you are going to use are decimals, example: 123,123" added temporarily to
the message at the beginning, it was added because we wanted to avoid errors when writing decimals
·While added, it is now an infinite calculator!!! It was complicated to add, I had to change the structure of the code completely
·THE "README" HAS BEEN ADDED!!!!!!
·Secret comment added in the code!!!
